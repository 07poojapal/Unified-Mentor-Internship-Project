About Dataset
This dataset contains web traffic records collected through AWS CloudWatch, aimed at detecting suspicious activities and potential attack attempts.
The data were generated by monitoring traffic to a production web server, using various detection rules to identify anomalous patterns.
 
Context
In today's cloud environments, cybersecurity is more crucial than ever. The ability to detect and respond to threats in real time can protect organizations from significant
consequences. This dataset provides a view of web traffic that has been labeled as suspicious, offering a valuable resource for developers, data scientists, and security
experts to enhance threat detection techniques.

Dataset Content
Each entry in the dataset represents a stream of traffic to a web server, including the following columns:
 1. bytes_in: Bytes received by the server.
 2. bytes_out: Bytes sent from the server.
 3. creation_time: Timestamp of when the record was created.
 4. end_time: Timestamp of when the connection ended.
 5. src_ip: Source IP address.
 6. src_ip_country_code: Country code of the source IP.
 7. protocol: Protocol used in the connection.
 8. response.code: HTTP response code.
 9. dst_port: Destination port on the server.
 10.dst_ip: Destination IP address.
 11.rule_names: Name of the rule that identified the traffic as suspicious.
 12.observation_name: Observations associated with the traffic.
 13.source.meta: Metadata related to the source.
 14.source.name: Name of the traffic source.
 15.time: Timestamp of the detected event.
 16.detection_types: Type of detection applied
